NAME
    Unicode::LineBreak - UAX #14 Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm

SYNOPSIS
        use Unicode::LineBreak;
        $lb = Unicode::LineBreak->new($string);
        $string = $lb->break;

DESCRIPTION
    Unicode::LineBreak performs Line Breaking Algorithm described in Unicode
    Standards Annex #14 [UAX #14]. East_Asian_Width informative properties
    [UAX #11] will be concerned to determin breaking points.

    NOTE: Current release of this module is pre-alpha just for
    proof-of-concept.

  Public Interface
    new STRING, [OPTIONS, ...]
        Constructor. Following OPTIONS may be specified.

        Charset => CHARSET
            Character set that is used to encode string STRING. Default is
            "UTF-8".

        Context => CONTEXT
            Along with Charset option, this may be used to define
            language/region context. Currently available contexts are
            "EASTASIAN" and "NONEASTASIAN". Default context is
            "NONEASTASIAN".

        HangulAsAL => "YES" | "NO"
            Treat hangul syllables and conjoining jamos as alphabetic
            characters (AL). Default is "NO".

        Language => LANGUAGE
            Along with Charset option, this may be used to define
            language/region context. See Context option.

        LegacyCM => "YES" | "NO"
            Treat combining characters lead by SPACE as an isolated
            combining character. As of Unicode 5.0, such use of SPACE is not
            recommended. Default is "YES".

        MaxColumns => NUMBER
            Maximum number of columns line may include not counting trailing
            spaces and newline sequence. In other words, maximum length of
            line. Default is 76.

        NSKanaAsID => "YES" | "NO"
            Treat hiragana/katakana small letters and prolonged signs (NS)
            as ideographic characters (ID). This feature is optional in [JIS
            X 4051]. Default is "NO".

        OutputCharset => CHARSET
            Character set that is used to encode result of break(). If a
            special value "_UNICODE_" is specified, result will be Unicode
            string. Default is "UTF-8".

    break
        Instance method. Break string and returns it.

  Configuration Files
    Built-in defaults of option parameters for "new" method can be
    overridden by configuration files: MIME/Charset/Defaults.pm and
    Unicode/LineBreak/Defaults.pm. For more details read
    Unicode/LineBreak/Defaults.pm.sample.

  Conformance to Standards
    Character properties based on by this module are defined by Unicode
    Standards version 5.1.0.

    This module implements UAX14-C2.

    *   Hiragana/katakana small letters and prolonged signs may be treated
        as either NS or ID by choice (See [JIS X 4051] 6.1.1).

    *   Hangul syllables and conjoining jamos may be treated as either
        H2/H3/JL/JT/JV or AL by choice.

    *   Characters assigned to AI may be resolved to either AL or ID by
        choice.

    *   Character(s) assigned to CB are not resolved.

    *   Characters assigned to SA are resolved to AL, except that characters
        that have General_Category Mn or Mc be resolved to CM.

    *   Characters assigned to SG or XX are resolved to AL.

CAVEAT
    *To be written*.
